pygame:
1. open spyder
2. navigate to "console" (should be next to History Log
	it is one of the tabs you can switch between on the
	bottom-right)
3. right click in the upper tab bar of console where "Python 1"
	and "Kernel 1" is; select "Open command prompt"
4. type "pip install pygame" and hit enter
voila
	
opengl:
1. click *windows key* + r
2. click "cmd" and hit enter
3. type "conda install pyopengl" and hit enter
4. wait for the prompt "Proceed ([y]/n)?", then type
	"y" and hit enter
voila

to test these were properly installed, navigate to the 
a python console (either "Python 1" tab in console or the 
"IPython console" works) and type:
"import pygame" + enter
"import OpenGL" + enter (mind the caps, capital O & G & L)

if both of these commands work without generating an 
erro then you are ready to go
